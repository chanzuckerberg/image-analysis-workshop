# NDCN computational biology training 2019 - Introduction to image analysis in python

This tutorial will introduce how to analyze images in Python, mainly using scikit-image. Here we will learn how to:
  * pre-process data using filtering, binarization and segmentation techniques.
  * inspect, count and measure attributes of objects and regions of interest in the data.
  * visualize 2D and 3D data using napari.

Please prepare for the tutorial by [installing the pre-requisite
software](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/scRNA-python-workshop/blob/master/content/intro/setup.md) beforehand.
