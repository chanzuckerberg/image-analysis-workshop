# ImageXD 2019 - scikit-image: Introduction/3D image processing

This tutorial will introduce how to analyze three dimensional stacked and volumetric
images in Python, mainly using scikit-image. Here we will learn how to:
  * pre-process data using filtering, binarization and segmentation techniques.
  * inspect, count and measure attributes of objects and regions of interest in the data.
  * visualize 3D data.

Please prepare for the tutorial by [installing the pre-requisite
software](preparation.md) beforehand.
