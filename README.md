# Introduction to image analysis

## Course goals

This tutorial will introduce how to analyze images in Python, mainly using scikit-image. We hope students leave with the ability to:

- Understand a general workflow for analyzing images
- Anticipate and avoid some of the most common pitfalls in image analysis
- Build intuition around the tradeoffs inherent in analytical choices
- Feel comfortable and confident working with current Python-based tools for image analysis
- Have better conversations with their collaborators
- Know where to find additional information and assistance

### Topics covered

We'll cover the basics of how to:

- Pre-process data using filtering, binarization and segmentation techniques
- Inspect, count and measure attributes of objects and regions of interest in the data
- Visualize 2D and 3D data using napari

## Prerequisites & resources

The workshop consists of explanatory discussions interspersed with hands-on exercises. **We strongly encourage you to bring a laptop with all required packages installed in order to fully participate.** Please follow the instructions [here](setup.md)

The course is intended for those who have basic familiarity with Python (e.g., at the level covered in a software carpentry workshop). Basic familiarity with the Jupyter notebooks and the command line is helpful but not required.

We recommend the following introductory materials:

- **Python**: Software Carpentry workshop on ["Plotting and Programming in Python"](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/)
- **Python**: [Codecademy Python3 course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) (free with trial).
- **Command line**: [Codecademy command line course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) (free with trial).
- **Jupyter notebooks**: [Coderefinery Jupyter workshop](https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/).

### Content

This course is an adaptation of one originally developed for the [2019 imageXD workshop](https://github.com/imagexd/2019-tutorial-skimage) using material from the [scikit-image tutorials](https://github.com/scikit-image/skimage-tutorials).
We gratefully acknowledge the work of the original authors of the course material, particularly: Alexandre de Siqueira, Daniela Ushizima, and Stefan van der Walt.

This course was first taught during one day of a CZI-sponsored workshop in Chicago, IL on October 18, 2019.
