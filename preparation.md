# Preparation

## Format

The tutorial consists of lecture segments followed by hands-on
exercises.  We *strongly encourage* you to bring a laptop with all
required packages installed in order to fully participate.

## Software required

- **Python**

  If you are new to Python, please install the
  [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for
  **Python version 3** (available on OSX, Linux, and Windows).
  Everyone else, feel free to use your favorite distribution, but
  please ensure the requirements below are met:

  - `python` >= 3.6
  - `numpy` >= 1.12
  - `scipy` >= 1.0
  - `matplotlib` >= 2.1
  - `scikit-image` >= 0.15
  - `itk` >= 4.1

  Please see "Test your setup" below.

- **ITK**

  ITK is an open-source toolkit for multidimensional image analysis.
  If you are using Anaconda, it is easy to install ITK using the
  [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) repository, through the
  following command:

  `$ conda install -c conda-forge itk`

  You can also use the PyPI package:

  `$ pip3 install --upgrade itk`

- **Jupyter**

  The lecture material includes Jupyter notebooks.  Please follow the
  [Jupyter installation instructions](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html),
  and ensure you have version 4 or later:

  ```bash
  $ jupyter --version
  4.4.0
  ```

  Please also activate Jupyter Widgets:

  ```
  pip install -q ipywidgets
  jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension
  ```

## Download lecture material

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Clone the repository at
   [https://github.com/imagexd/2019-tutorial-skimage](https://github.com/imagexd/2019-tutorial-skimage)

We may make editorial corrections to the material until the day before
the workshop, so please execute `git pull` to update.

## Using a conda environment

We created the file `environment.yml`, available on the repository you cloned
during the last step, to ease the process of creating an environment ready for this
tutorial. To use this environment, you can use the command `conda env`:

`$ conda env create -f environment.yml`

Then, to activate it,

` $ conda activate imagexd19_skimage`

To come back to your master environment, use

`$ conda activate`

More on conda environments at the [conda's user guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

## Test your setup

Please switch into the repository you downloaded in the previous step,
and run `check_setup.py` to validate your installation.

On my computer, I see (but your version numbers may differ):

```
[✓] scikit-image  0.15.0
[✓] numpy         1.14.5
[✓] scipy         1.1.0
[✓] matplotlib    2.2.2
[✓] notebook      5.4.0
```
**If you do not have a working setup, please contact the instructors.**
